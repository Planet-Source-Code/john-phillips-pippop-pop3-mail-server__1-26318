' PipPop POP3 Email Server copyright Â©2001 CSMG, Inc. (John Phillips)
' Created by John Phillips, MCP
' Computer Systems Management Group, Inc.
' This version of pipop was thrown together real quick for
' upload to Planet-Source-Code
' As it stands right now pipop was only tested on windows 98
' I plan to test it on modify as needed on winows NT , 2000
' This version is not complete and was only tested with one client connecting at
' a single session - multiple client support will be supported in
' future releases - also this version does not support attachments
'
' This was also tested using Outlook express
' so let me know if there is a problem connecting
' with other mail clients
'
' any question about this server please email me at
' vbjack@nyc.rr.com with PIPPOP Code somewhere in the subject Line
'
' the reason i started creating such a server is simple
' I need to provide email support for most of my clients
' and they want an inexpensive way of doing so
' so after finding out that the free POP3 servers arent that easy to understand
' and the easy ones are very expensive for multible clients
' I decided to see if I could create my own
' I will be uploading updates to this server for everyone to use
' provided anyone who uses this code put my name somewhere in the credits
' with CSMG, Inc.
